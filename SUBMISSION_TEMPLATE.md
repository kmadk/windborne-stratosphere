# WindBorne Application Submission Template

Once your app is deployed, use this template for your application:

## Application JSON

```json
{
  "career_application": {
    "name": "YOUR_NAME",
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
    "role": "Flight Team Web Developer",
    "notes": "Full-stack developer passionate about atmospheric science and real-time data visualization. I chose to integrate jet stream data because understanding atmospheric dynamics is crucial for optimizing balloon flight paths - jet streams can accelerate balloons to 200+ mph, dramatically affecting trajectory predictions and mission planning.",
    "submission_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
    "portfolio_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
    "resume_url": "YOUR_RESUME_URL"
  }
}
```

## Submit via cURL

Once you have all URLs ready:

```bash
curl -X POST https://windbornesystems.com/career_applications.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "career_application": {
      "name": "YOUR_NAME",
      "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "role": "Flight Team Web Developer",
      "notes": "Full-stack developer passionate about atmospheric science and real-time data visualization. I chose to integrate jet stream data because understanding atmospheric dynamics is crucial for optimizing balloon flight paths - jet streams can accelerate balloons to 200+ mph, dramatically affecting trajectory predictions and mission planning.",
      "submission_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
      "portfolio_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
      "resume_url": "YOUR_RESUME_URL"
    }
  }'
```
