# üöÄ Deployment Guide for WindBorne StratoSphere

## Quick Deploy to Vercel

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**

   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `windborne-stratosphere`
   - Keep it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/windborne-stratosphere.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel:**

   - Visit https://vercel.com
   - Sign up/login with GitHub

2. **Import your project:**

   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your `windborne-stratosphere` repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - No configuration needed - everything is set up!

3. **Wait for deployment (1-2 minutes)**
   - Vercel will build and deploy automatically
   - You'll get a URL like: `windborne-stratosphere.vercel.app`
