## Prepare Your Application

Once deployed, prepare these URLs for your WindBorne application:

```json
{
  "career_application": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "role": "Flight Team Web Developer",
    "notes": "Full-stack developer with expertise in real-time data visualization and atmospheric science applications. I integrated jet stream analysis to demonstrate how atmospheric dynamics affect balloon trajectories - understanding these patterns is critical for flight path optimization as jet streams can accelerate balloons to over 200 mph.",
    "submission_url": "https://your-app.vercel.app",
    "portfolio_url": "https://your-app.vercel.app",
    "resume_url": "https://your-app.vercel.app/resume.pdf"
  }
}
```
