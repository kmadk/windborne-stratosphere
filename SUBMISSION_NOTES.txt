WINDBORNE APPLICATION - SUBMISSION NOTES

Project: StratoSphere - Atmospheric Intelligence Platform

External Dataset Choice: NOAA GFS Model (250mb pressure level)
=================================================================

Why I chose NOAA atmospheric data:

WindBorne's balloons actively navigate by changing altitude to catch different wind layers. 
By integrating NOAA GFS model data at the 250mb pressure level (jet stream altitude), 
my platform demonstrates understanding of the core physics behind balloon navigation. 
The visualization shows how balloons positioned at 10-12km altitude can exploit jet streams 
to achieve ground speeds exceeding 200 mph, turning atmospheric dynamics into a navigation tool.

Key Insights Demonstrated:
- Real-time identification of balloons riding jet streams
- Correlation between altitude and available wind speeds
- Optimal positioning for rapid global transit
- How atmospheric patterns affect balloon trajectories over 24 hours

This isn't just data visualization - it's a demonstration of how understanding atmospheric 
physics can optimize balloon fleet operations, reduce transit times, and improve global coverage.

Technical Implementation:
- Fetches live balloon data from WindBorne API (24 hours)
- Integrates NOAA atmospheric model data for wind patterns
- Analyzes balloon-atmosphere interactions in real-time
- Updates dynamically as new data arrives
