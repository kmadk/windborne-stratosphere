# Your WindBorne Application is Ready!

## Your Resume URL

Once Vercel finishes deploying (usually takes 1-2 minutes after pushing), your resume will be available at:

```
https://windborne-stratosphere-[YOUR-VERCEL-ID].vercel.app/resume.pdf
```

Or if you have a custom domain:
```
https://windborne-stratosphere.vercel.app/resume.pdf
```

## Complete Application JSON

Replace the placeholders and submit this:

```json
{
  "career_application": {
    "name": "Kelton J. Madden",
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
    "role": "Flight Team Web Developer",
    "notes": "Full-stack developer with expertise in real-time data visualization and atmospheric science applications. I integrated jet stream analysis to demonstrate how atmospheric dynamics affect balloon trajectories - understanding these patterns is critical for flight path optimization as jet streams can accelerate balloons to over 200 mph.",
    "submission_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
    "portfolio_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
    "resume_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL/resume.pdf"
  }
}
```

## Submit via Terminal

Once you have your Vercel URL, run this command (replace placeholders):

```bash
curl -X POST https://windbornesystems.com/career_applications.json \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "career_application": {
      "name": "Kelton J. Madden",
      "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "role": "Flight Team Web Developer",
      "notes": "Full-stack developer with expertise in real-time data visualization and atmospheric science applications. I integrated jet stream analysis to demonstrate how atmospheric dynamics affect balloon trajectories - understanding these patterns is critical for flight path optimization as jet streams can accelerate balloons to over 200 mph.",
      "submission_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
      "portfolio_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL",
      "resume_url": "YOUR_VERCEL_URL/resume.pdf"
    }
  }'
```
